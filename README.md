# Gravel Carts

## Minecarts travel wayyy faster on rails on gravel.

In Minecraft, there are minecarts, which are an obsolete form of transportation. Nearly every type of transportation in the game is better than it--elytras, horses, boats (especially on ice), and even sprint-jumping with a block above your head. That being said, minecarts do have a very good application at the moment: redstone. If minecarts' speed were to simply be increased to better compete with other forms of transportation, it would negatively affect redstone applications. So, a compromise: *the blocks underneath the rails determine the minecarts' max speed.*

In this mod there are a variety of ways to increase the minecarts' speed:
- Cobblestone or Cobbled Deepslate underneath rails increases minecarts' max speed to 1.5x normal max speed
- Gravel underneath rails increases minecarts' max speed to 2.0x normal max speed
- Raw Gold underneath rails increases minecarts' max speed to 2.5x normal max speed
- If you put a second layer of gravel underneath any block with rails on top, it increases the speed again by a further 1.25x. This makes a new max speed of 3.125x the original minecart max speed with raw gold and gravel underneath.

All of the blocks are configurable using block tags, and the amount of layers counted underneath are configurable in the  mod config (Setting the layer amount to zero disables it, and setting it to -1 makes it unlimited).

This mod was inspired by an old r/minecraftsuggestions post! [Check it out here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/czljdy/minecart_speed_increases_when_gravel_is_put_under/)
